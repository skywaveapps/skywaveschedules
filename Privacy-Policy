Privacy Policy
The author developed the Skywave Radio Schedules app as a free app in the hope that it is useful. This app is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform website visitors regarding the policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use the app.

Information Collection and Use
The app does not collect information used to identify you, however the app delivery system Google Play Services will collect information about you and I recommend you read their Privacy Policy. GitHub and KiwiSDR may also store information about you and I recommend you read their Privacy Policies. Accessing any websites from the app will result in storing cookies and suggest you check the sites privacy policies before visiting them and decide whether you want to continue using the app.  

Whenever you use Skywave Radio Schedules no data is collected about you by the app, when you use the app or carry out an update to the schedules, the websites you visit may collect information about your connection to the server, but the app will not collect any personal data about you or your device. Your install and use of the app is your permission to Google Play to store information about you.
The app requires permission to connect to the internet to download a schedules update, but will only do this when you request it. Part of this process involves saving data to read/write data to the built in storage area on your device in order to present the update to the app and thefore also requires storage permissions. You will have to agree to these permissions prior to installing the app.
